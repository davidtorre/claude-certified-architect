# to call this tool or a built-in tool like Grep.

    # DONE [Step 4, Task 2.1]: This description is too vague — the agent cannot tell
    # what this tool offers that Grep doesn't. Enhance it to include:
    #   - What content it searches (API specs, architecture decisions,
    #     onboarding guides, known tech debt — NOT source code)
    #   - What it returns (structured results with title, section, content)
    #   - When to use it INSTEAD of Grep (internal project documentation
    #     vs searching source code patterns)
    #   - Example queries: "architecture", "API endpoints", "tech debt"
    # A clear description outcompetes built-in tools by telling the agent
    # exactly when this tool is the better choice.
